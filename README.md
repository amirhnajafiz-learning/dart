# Dart

Dart is a client-optimized language 
for developing fast apps on any platform. 
Its goal is to offer the most productive 
programming language for multi-platform 
development, paired with a flexible execution 
runtime platform for app frameworks.

## Why Dart?

Dart is a modern, type-safe, and easily 
accessible language developed by Google. 
It compiles to native desktop and mobile platforms
and transpiles to JavaScript for web apps.

workflow with hot reloading, so you can quickly iterate on your code.


Flutter is made as a cross-platform SDK 
that can be used to build frontend and 
backend applications in a variety of 
programming languages, including Dart, 
Java, C/C++, and more. 

Its powerful framework and tools make 
it easy to quickly build high-quality
mobile apps for any purpose.
